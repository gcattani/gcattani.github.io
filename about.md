Giovanni lives in Milano (Italy) and works as an IT security consultant. He likes to mess around with applications and occasionally develops stuff.

You can find Giovanni on [<i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i> LinkedIn][linkedin] and [<i class="fa fa-github-square"></i> GitHub][github]. You could also send him an old-fashioned <a href="mailto:&#103;%69%6f&#118;&#46;&#99;&#97;%74&#116;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;%69%6c%2e&#99;%6f%6d"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> e-mail</a> (also using [GPG][key]).

Still not enough? Get more boring information in his [curriculum vitae][cv].
